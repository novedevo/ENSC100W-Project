# ENSC100W-Project

Collaborative repository containing all software elements required to run an automated pet feeder.

All source code is contained in /main/

Ensure the Blynk libraries are installed somewhere your preprocessor is aware of, the Arduino IDE has tools for this.

Ensure you fill in your SSID, password, and Blynk authn key in main.ino. 

If you use Visual Studio Code, the contents of /.vscode/ may be of use to you.
